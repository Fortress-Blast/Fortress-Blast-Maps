Fortress Blast maps repository
==============================

This repository contains additional map support that the base version of Fortress Blast does not come with. You can pick and choose .json files from this repository to add to your server, depending on what maps you have in rotation. If you cannot find the map you need support for, you can create a .json file yourself and fork this repository in order to send a pull request that will be manually reviewed.
